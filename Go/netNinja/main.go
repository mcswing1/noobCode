// Every Go file that is created will be part of a package, which is a collection of files and code.
// If the package is called "main", this tells the Go compiler that the code should be compiled into an executable program at the end.
package main

// Package from the Go standard library. "fmt" is for formatting strings and printing messages to the console.
import "fmt"

// All functions will start with "func" keyword. The main() function is the entry point of our application.
// There must be one and only one main() function.
func main() {

	fmt.Println("Hello, ninjas!")

}
